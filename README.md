what is XPC ?  XPC is stands for XNU (the kernel used by iOS-macOS) 
inter-Process Communication, is a framework for communication between processes on macOS and iOS. XPC provides a mechanism for making safe, asynchronous method calls between different processes on the system

safe, asynchronous method calls between different processes on the system. It's a part of Apple's security paradigm, allowing for the creation of privilege-separated applications where each component runs with only the permissions it needs to do its job, thereby limiting the potential damage from a compromised process.
XPC uses a form of Inter-Process Communication (IPC), which is a set of methods for different programs running on the same system to send data back and forth.


how i can intercept the XPC Messages Using this code ?

this code will intercept the messages with memory addresses 
and it will give you the Message Type and Memory Address to give you a greate Analysis 


frist i will give you an example :

frist you need to know the name of any service and get into it using frida framework

frida -n <Service Name>



when you enter to the service adjust the Repo Source code to your target service process and inject the code into the process using;

[Local::PID::523 ]-> %load XPCrootinterceptor.js 

it will ask you if you want to load the script or no Type y to inject 

Are you sure you want to load a new script and discard all current state? [y/N] y


now try to open or Interact with your service and you will see all of your service activities 







thank you and have nice day
